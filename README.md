### Research
      
###	A brief curriculum vitae


I am an associate professor at the [Gran Sasso Science Institute](www.gssi.it) and at the [University of Leicester](www.cs.le.ac.uk).

My main research interests are in theoretical and applied aspects of
complex distributed systems. Recently I have been working on automata-
and behavioural type-based models of distributed choreographies,
contract-based models of distributed interactions, and their
application to software engineering of distributed and concurrent
systems.

I graduated (1998) and got my PhD degree in Computer Science (2003) at
the [department of Computer Science, University of
Pisa](www.di.unipi.it).


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/eMwww/trash/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/eMwww/trash/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
