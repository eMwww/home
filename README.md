##	A brief curriculum vitae

I am an associate professor at the [Gran Sasso Science Institute](www.gssi.it) and at the [University of Leicester](www.cs.le.ac.uk).
My main research interests are in theoretical and applied aspects of complex distributed systems. Recently I have been working on automata- and behavioural type-based models of distributed choreographies, contract-based models of distributed interactions, and their application to software engineering of distributed and concurrent systems.

I graduated (1998) and got my PhD degree in Computer Science (2003) at the [department of Computer Science, University of Pisa](www.di.unipi.it).
