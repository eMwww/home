### Welcome to Emilio's web page

     
##	A brief curriculum vitae

I am an associate professor at the [Gran Sasso Science Institute](www.gssi.it) and at the [University of Leicester](www.cs.le.ac.uk).
My main research interests are in theoretical and applied aspects of complex distributed systems. Recently I have been working on automata- and behavioural type-based models of distributed choreographies, contract-based models of distributed interactions, and their application to software engineering of distributed and concurrent systems.

I graduated (1998) and got my PhD degree in Computer Science (2003) at the [department of Computer Science, University of Pisa](www.di.unipi.it).

## Projects
I'm currently collaborating in the following projects:
- [BehAPI](https://www.um.edu.mt/projects/behapi): EU RISE Action, co-PI + site and WP4 leader; started in March 2018
- RCADE: EU MSCA Fellowship, co-PI Claudio Mezzina joined in September 2018 our department as MSCA fellow collaborating with  [Irek Ulidowski](http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/iu3/) and me on causal consistency reversible debuggers. Shortly after the project was discontinued because Claudio got a permanent position in Italy
- [Reversible Computation](http://www.revcomp.eu): EU Cost Action
- [BETTY](http://www.behavioural-types.eu):EU COST Action (RTD Framework Programme).

	
I have contributed several the Leverhulme project Tracing Networks, several EU-funded projects (PROFUNDIS, AGILE, and DEGAS) as well as some Italian projects (COMETA, SP4 and NAPI).
