The course will explore this topic presenting different paradigms of coordination of concurrent and distributed systems (including shared-memory, message-passing, and tuple spaces) as well as related linguistic constructs. The theoretical underpinning will be reinforced by showing how popular programming languages feature concurrency."

  syllabus: "<b>Auxiliary course</b><br/><b>Lecturer: Hernán C. Melgratti, CONICET and U. of Buenos Aires, AR</b><br/>The design-by-contract approach promotes the usage of executable specifications to describe the mutual obligations that regulate the interaction between different modules. Contracts are embedded in code and checked at runtime to help developers identify faulty modules. Behavioural types instead  provide a description of the interaction aspects of a program and are used to specify the communication protocols that regulate the communication among distributed components. In this course we will present the current approaches for combining contracts and behavioural types. We will cover the following topics: Design-by-Contract approach (DbC), Higher-order contracts (Findler & Felleisen), Binary Session Types, Chaperone contracts for session types, Multiparty Session Types (MST), DbC for MST, Dependent Session Types, Dependent types and smart contracts. The course requires no prior knowledge of the subjects."

Instead of exploiting over-approximations to prove program correctness like done with classical formal methods, incorrectness reasoning exploits under-approximations for exposing true bugs. The overall goal of incorrectness methods is to develop principled techniques to assist programmers with timely feedback about the presence of true errors, with few or zero false alarms.<br/>The course will overview different approaches, like program logics, pointer analysis, and abstract interpretation, for both over- and under-approximation, as well as their combination."

  syllabus: "<b>Advanced course</b><br/><b>Lecturer: António Ravara, Universidad NOVA, Lisbon</b><br/>Concurrent and distributed software is nowadays pervasive to most computing devices. However, it is particularly difficult to design and validate. Concurrency bugs appear frequently and have a substantial impact, as not only they may affect many people, but also may cause a severe financial damage. There is thus a pressing need of using rigorous approaches and tools to specify and verify such systems. Industrial actors like Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, or NASA, just to name a few, are using tools to formally guarantee that (parts of) their software is bug-free.
This course covers basic principles, techniques, and some tools to help on the challenging task of developing concurrent software systems. This involves understanding languages to specify systems and their properties. There are various kind of key properties of concurrent systems; we will focus on basic safety and liveness properties, which are enough to express functional requirements of concurrent and distributed algorithms.
Note - all lectures have a companion list of suggested exercises (and I am available in office hours to help with them and provide feedback about your solutions)."
