  syllabus: "The course introduces to formal models of computations with a focus on concurrency (both shared-memory and communication-based concurrency). The main topics of the course are operational semantics and (labelled) transition systems, regular expressions, basic process algebras. Preliminary concepts of software verification, typical verification flow, common program analysis techniques, decision procedures. Basic concepts of software modelling and analysis with stochastic processes, discrete-time markov processes, and petri nets.<br/>The topics of the <b>first part</b> are: operational semantics and (labelled) transition systems, regular expressions, basic process algebras."

  syllabus: "This course introduces to the formal modelling and verification through classical model checking approaches of systems. The course poses particular emphasis on the so-called reactive systems, which embrace a wide range of modern distributed and communicating systems. The main topics of the course are temporal logics (specifically LTL, CTL, and CTL*), safety and liveness properties of reactive systems as well as fairness conditions. Some basic model checking algorithms are presented and their application to realistic scenarios is analysed."
