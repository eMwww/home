- topic: Choregraphic automata and formal languages 
  authors: Franco Barbanera and Ivan Lanese
  descr: We are setting an abstract framework for choreographies based on formal languages.

- topic: Choregraphy-driven testing
  authors: Alex Coto and Roberto Guanciale
  descr: Model-driven testing based on choreographies...a first step. We introduce _admissible_ tests and show how to derive them from global specifications.
  
- topic: Refinement of choreographies
  authors: Ugo de'Liguoro and Hernan Melgratti
  descr: We want to equip choreographies with refinement mechanisms in order to enhance modular development.

- topic: Data-driven behavioural specifications
  authors: Hernan Melgratti
  descr: We advocate a different _nature_ of behavioural specifications that concern more data- than control-flow of protocols.
