- topic: Compositional global views of choreographies
  authors: Franco Barbanera, Mariangiola-Dezani Ciancaglini, and Ivan Lanese
  descr: A main drawback of global views of choreographies is that they are not compositional. We are tackling this problem.
  
- topic: Choregraphy-driven testing
  authors: Alex Coto and Roberto Guanciale
  descr: Model-driven testing based on choreographies...a first step. We introduce _admissible_ tests and show how to derive them from global specifications.
  
- topic: Refinement of choreographies
  authors: Ugo de'Liguoro and Hernan Melgratti
  descr: We want to equip choreographies with refinement mechanisms in order to enhance modular development.
  
- topic: Probabilistic session types
  authors: Omar Inverso, Hernan Melgratti, Luca Padovani, and Catia Trubiani
  descr: We introduce a probabilistic variant of binary session types to reason about the probability that a session terminates successfully. A typing discipline is given so that the success probability of well-typed processes agrees with that of their sessions.

- topic: Data-driven behavioural specifications
  authors: Hernan Melgratti
  descr: We advocate a different _nature_ of behavioural specifications that concern more data- than control-flow of protocols.
