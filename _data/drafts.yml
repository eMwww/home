- title: "On Resolving Non-determinism in Choreographies"
  author: "Laura Bocchi and Hernan Melgratti"
  descr: "The paper introduces the idea of _whole spectrum realisation_ and a type system to enforce this property."

- title: "Towards Refinable Choreographies"
  author: "Ugo de'Liguoro and Hernan Melgratti"
  descr: "We investigate refinement in the context of choreographies allowing for the underspecification of protocols through _refinable_ interactions. A typing discipline enforces well-formedness."

- title: "Probabilistic Analysis of Binary Sessions"
  author: "Omar Inverso, Hernan Melgratti, Luca Padovani, and Catia Trubiani"
  descr: "We introduce a probabilistic variant of binary session types to reason about the probability that a session terminates successfully. A typing discipline is given so that the success probability of well-typed processes agrees with that of their sessions."

- title: "Composition and Decomposition of Multiparty Sessions"
  author: "Franco Barbanera, Mariangiola Dezani-Ciancaglini, and Ivan Lanese"
  descr: "A compositional framework of _open_ global types where two participants act as coupled _gateways_ forwarding messages between the two sessions. We show that the session resulting from the composition can be typed starting from global types. Lock-freedom is preserved by composition. We also propose a _decomposition_ operator which is the left inverse of direct composition."

- title: "Composing Communicating Systems, Synchronously"
  author: "Franco Barbanera and Ivan Lanese"
  descr: "As in the previous draft, but in a setting based on automata. We discuss how to ensure relevant communication (eg deadlock freedom) in a compositional way. The idea is that communicating systems can be composed by transforming two of their participants andthem into coupled forwarders. The synchronous case is surprisingly intriguing."

- title: "Choreography Automata"
  author: "Franco Barbanera and Ivan Lanese"
  descr: "We introduce choreography automata for the choreographic modelling of communicating systems, project them on communicating finite-state machines, and consider both the standard asynchronous semantics of communicating systems and a synchronous variant of it. For both, the projections of well-formed automata are proved to be live as well as lock- and deadlock-free."
