- title: Towards Refinable Choreographies
  author: Ugo de'Liguoro  and Hernan Melgratti
  descr: We investigate refinement in the context of choreographies allowing for the underspecification of protocols through _refinable_ interactions. A typing discipline enforces well-formedness.

- title: Probabilistic Analysis of Binary Sessions
  author: Omar Inverso, Hernan Melgratti, Luca Padovani, and Catia Trubiani
  descr:   We introduce a probabilistic variant of binary session types to reason about the probability that a session terminates successfully. A typing discipline is given so that the success probability of well-typed processes agrees with that of their sessions.

- title: An Abstract Framework for Choreographic Testing
  author: Alex Coto and Roberto Guanciale
  descr: Model-driven testing based on choreographies...a first step. We introduce _admissible_ tests and show how to derive them from global specifications.

- title: Composition and Decomposition of Multiparty Sessions
  author: Franco Barbanera, Mariangiola Dezani-Ciancaglini, and Ivan Lanese
  descr: A compositional framework of _open_ global types where two participants act as coupled _gateways_ forwarding messages between the two sessions. We show that the session resulting from the composition can be typed starting from global types. Lock-freedom is preserved by composition. We also propose a _decomposition_ operator which is the left inverse of direct composition.

- title: Composing Communicating Systems, Synchronously
  author: Franco Barbanera and Ivan Lanese
  descr: As in the previous draft, but in a setting based on automata. We discuss how to ensure relevant communication (eg deadlock freedom) in a compositional way. The idea is that communicating systems can be composed by transforming two of their participants andthem into coupled forwarders. The synchronous case is surprisingly intriguing.
