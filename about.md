# About me

My main research interests are in theoretical and applied aspects of
distributed and mobile systems. Recently I've been working on
automata- and type-based models of distributed choreographies,
contract- and graph-based models of distributed interactions, and on
nominal automata.


# A brief CV

I am an associate professor at the [Gran Sasso Science
Institute](http://www.gssi.it).  Before joining the GSSI I have been
associate professor of the [School of
Informatics](https://cs.le.ac.uk/) of [University of
Leicester](https://www.le.ac.uk), which I joined in October 2005 as a
lecturer of the (at that time) Department of Computer Science.  

Before joining Leicester, I have been a research associate (2003-2005)
at the Dipartimento di Informatica (University of Pisa).

I graduated (1998) and got my PhD degree in Computer Science (2003) at
the department of Computer Science, University of Pisa.
