# Recent stuff

Here is a list of recent topics I have been recently playing with:
- Compositional global views of choreographies (joint work with Franco Barbanera, Mariangiola-Dezani Ciancaglini, and Ivan Lanese)
- Choregraphy-driven testing (joint work with Alex Coto and Roberto Guanciale)
- Refinement of choreographies (joint work with Ugo de'Liguoro and Hernan Melgratti)
- Probabilistic session types (joint work with Omar Inverso, Hernan Melgratti, Luca Padovani, and Catia Trubiani)
- Data-driven behavioural specifications (joing work with Hernan Melgratti)

Of course, I always try to advance [ChorGram](https://bitbucket.org/emlio_tuosto/chorgram/wiki/Home)...with the help of Alex Coto this we should speed up on this.
